'''
As explained before, Variables are containers for storing data values.
We can create a variable by giving it a name and store any value we want.
We get to choose the name of the variable.
It is always advised that a variables name must describe the kind of value it will store 
or describe the function it will serve

'''
# Example:
name = "LINDA MUCASSI"

'''
On the above code, the varianble name is created, this is called declaration in computer science
After that a value is assigned to the variable, the value is the string "LINDA MUCASSI", 
this way of creating a variable is called "initialization"

In python when creating a variable you do not need to specify the kind of value that will be stored,
by giving it a value python will know the data type of the variable, in the exxample above the variable is a string,

TASK 1:
Create 5 variables and store the following values, make sure to nasme them proparly
- 42
- 84.106
- "May The Code Be With Me!"
- "TheTerminal School Rocks"
- "T"
'''
__ = 42
__ = 84.106
__ = "May The Code Be With Me!"
__ = "TheTerminal School Rocks"
__ = "T"

'''
TASK 2:
Just by looking at these variable names, specify what values can be stored for each
'''

student = # your answer here
students = # your answer here
age = # your answer here
year = # your answer here
num_of_pupils = # your answer here

'''
RULES:
As you may have seen, we as the programmer decide the name of the variable, but every programming language 
has names that are reserved for specific use for the compiler, so we need to know how to name variables

'''
# Variables can not start with a number
42_names = "A list of 42 names"

# A variable can not be numbers only
42 = 42

# A variable can not be named after key/reserved words
# a list of python's keywords https://realpython.com/lessons/reserved-keywords/
False = "True"
for = "let's loop"
pass = "we move on"
else = "you get the point, right?"

# A variable can not consist of special characters
num_of_% = 42%

# A variable can consiste of numbers at the end only
school1 = "The first ever school"
file_2 = "second file"

'''
Other rules are not really rules but a way of writing code, as we have read the Zen of Python, naming
variables also means we need to make sure our code is readable, and at the same time we do not complicate our code

TASK 3:
Determine which variables are well names and which ones are not

'''
number_of_students_per_course = 1987
# is this variabkle name good or bad?

todays_date = "What day is it again?"
# is this variabkle name good or bad?

x = 4
# is this variabkle name good or bad?

x_2
# is this variabkle name good or bad?

3x = 45
# is this variabkle name good or bad?

temparature_in_degrees_celcius = 34
# is this variabkle name good or bad?

temparature = 54
# is this variabkle name good or bad?

'''
This is just an introduction to variables, there is clearly a lot that one can learn and play around with variables

For instead, how to initialize variables in a chain
name, surname = "Linda", "MUCASSI"

Also, explore how to store values to a variable from a different variable, but we shall cover more as we proceed
