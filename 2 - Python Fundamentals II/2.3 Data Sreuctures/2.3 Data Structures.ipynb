    "Data Structures are a specific method of arranging and storing data in computers so that we can execute more efficient operations on the data. Data structures are used in a wide range of fields, including Computer Science and Software Engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will look into the following Data Structures:\n",
    "1. Lists \n",
    "2. Dictionaries, Maps, and Hash Tables\n",
    "3. Records, Structs, and Data Transfer Objects\n",
    "4. Records, Structs, and Data Transfer Objects\n",
    "5. Stacks (LIFOs)\n",
    "6. Queues (FIFOs)\n",
    "7. Priority Queues\n",
    "8. Conclusion: Python Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previouse task you were introduced to dat types, data types helps us understand the nature of data, but as you may have seen, we can only store one type of data in most variable, i.e: only whole numbers can be stored in an int variable, and so to the other types, excluding a dictionary, set, tuple and a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming you will be faced with a lot of challenges that requires you to group data of different types, in this part of the course we will explore techniques and tools that python provides for us to accomplish or solve such problems"
