# DAWP - Data Analysis With Python
### Introduction

---

This is a compilation of tasks aimed to teach how to use python for data analysis and exploration. This project will be a practical first approach.

**NOTE:** We need to create a dropbox so we can share these files and this will also make it easier for me to evaluate your progress, if you can use git that would actually be better*

### 1. Python Fundamentals

---

#### Environment Setup

- [x]  Install Python
- [x]  Install Anaconda
- [x]  GIT BASH
- [x]  Setup IDE/Text Editor (VSCODE)

Command-Line Prompts

- **cd**: change directory (directory: Folder). Can be used in both Windows and Linux
    - Used to move between folders ( going back and forth)
    - Syntax: **cd** path (foldername or actual path)
    
- **dir**: directory - lists the contents of a directory(**ls** on linux)
    - Syntax: **dir**
    
- **cls**: clear screen - clears the terminal screen on windows, **clear** is the equivalent of **cls** on linux
    - Syntax: **cls**
    
- **mkdir**: make directory - used to create folders
    - Syntax: **mkdir** FolderName
    
- **mv**: moving and renaming folder and files
    - Syntax: **mv** OriginalFile FileToRenameTo (renaming)
    - Syntax: **mv** OriginalPath PathToMoveTo (moving)
    
- command to create files*
- command to view files*
- Print in terminal: python name_of_file.py
- command to remove files - **rm** filename
- command (flag— start with a dash) to remove folders:  rm -r foldername
- command to open Jupyter notebook in the current folder or anywhere else*

WORKING WITH GIT + GITHUB

- [x]  create a github account (github.com), if you already have one then proceeded
- [x]  create a repository on github and name it “Data Analysis With Python”, you can make the repo public or private it is up to you
- [x]  When done, add lindasmucassi@gmail.com as a contributor to the project/repository
- [x]  clone the repository to your local environment
- [x]  move your current work to the local repository
- [x]  git add, commit and push the changes

GIT COMMANDS*

- git clone
- git add
- git status
- git commit -m “message”
- git push
- git pull
- camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case
- more...

#### Syntax

- [x]  History Of Python
- [x]  The Zen of Python
- [ ]  Can identify python code
- [x]  Can explain a few differences between python and other languages
- [x]  Difference between .py and .ipynb
- [x]  python on the command prompt vs python on notebook

#### Variables

- TASK 1:
    - [x]  Create a file called variables.py inside the pythonFundamentals folder
    - [x]  Open the file created above in text editor or IDE
    - [x]  create a variable and store in it the number “42”
    - [x]  print out the variable to the console/terminal/command line prompt
    - [x]  print out the type of the variable to the console/terminal/command line prompt
- TASK 2:
    - [ ]  Create a file called variables.ipynb inside the pythonFundamentals folder
    - [ ]  Open the file created above in a jupyter notebook environment
    - [ ]  create a variable in a cell and store in it the number “42”
    - [ ]  print out the variable inside the notebook
    - [ ]  print out the type of the variable inside the notebook

#### Print

- TASK 3: Create a file called prints.ipynb and write code to show all kinds of printing formats
    
    Understand different types of formatting print statements(e.g f string, format,...) resource: [https://www.delftstack.com/howto/python/python-print-variable/](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/python/python-print-variable/)
    
    - [ ]  print a sentence
    - [ ]  print a variable using the ‘+’ operator in a sentence
    - [ ]  print a variable using an f string
    - [ ]  print a variable using the format method
    - [ ]  [Use a Comma `,` to Separate the Variables and Print Them](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/python/python-print-variable/#use-a-comma-to-separate-the-variables-and-print-them)
    - [ ]  [Use the String Formatting With the Help of `%`](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/python/python-print-variable/#use-the-string-formatting-with-the-help-of)

#### Errors

- TASK4: Create a file named errors.ipynb and open it in a notebook, then write code to reproduce these errors:
    - [ ]  Syntax Error
    - [ ]  Zero Division Error
    - [ ]  Indentation Error
    - [ ]  Name Error
    - [ ]  Type Error
    - [ ]  Memory Error
    - [ ]  [More](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/errors-and-exceptions-in-python/)(← this is a link)

#### Error Handling

- TASK 5: Create a file named error_handling.ipynb and write code to handle all the errors in TASK 4, add more error exceptions other than the ones in task 4
    - [ ]  [Try Except](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/errors-and-exceptions-in-python/)

### 2. Data Manipulation

#### Data Types

- TASK 1: Open the file named data_types.ipynb
    - [ ]  Create 5 variables and store different data types in them, name them however you want
    - [ ]  print all your variables
    - [ ]  print the types of your variables
- TASK2: Open the file named data_manip.ipynb
    - [ ]  Go through the provided notebook and complete the task, instructions are provided inside
- TASK 3: Create a file called string_manip.ipynb
